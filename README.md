## Getting Started

First, run the server:

```bash
npm run bruh
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see
nine maps that can be banned/picked/played.

This map ban works by the CSM classic tournament rules meaning:

1. 3 Bans ➡️ 2 Picks ➡️ Play pick
2. The one who wins can't **PICK** that map anymore (lock icon on the map)
   ((first person to win is assigned blue lock, second person is assigned red
   lock)
3. 3 Bans ➡️ Play pick The third point is repeated until the series ends.
